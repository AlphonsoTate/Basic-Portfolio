    Where to start, hmm... perhaps I should mention that I am a past paralegal student <br>
      
    at Robert Morris University, Or I shall also mention that I am dynamic<br>
       
    recording artist from the southside/suburbs of Chicago. Music, traveling, <br>
       
    and learning are my most beloved passions. I hold quite a interest in political <br>
        
    studies and national history. In my spare time I enjoy cooking,<br>
        
    researching, and shopping. I like to think of myself as a well rounded individual <br>

    with insight in many forums of knowledge. Maybe thats the reason my stage name is Phenom Phons. I hope to endure and create a brand of 
pure innovation and influence in the developing realm. I am humble to learn and apply my greatest effort towards succeeding in any endeavor I may commit myself too. </p>
